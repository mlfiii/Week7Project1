To get a summary of the article as well as its sentiment analysis, click the "SUMMARY" button and the summary and sentiment analysis will load underneath the headline of the article. The sentiment of an article can be one of three things: "POSITIVE" (shown in green), "NEGATIVE" (shown in red), or "NEUTRAL" (shown in yellow). The corresponding confidence value of the analysis will be displayed as a percentage in parentheses next to the sentiment. To copy the generated summary, click the "COPY TO CLIPBOARD" button.
